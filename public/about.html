<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I am Pablo.

I am a Web Developer, Data Analyst, and Automation Specialist based in Spain, passionate about building digital solutions that are both functional and intelligent.

I work at the intersection of web development, data analysis, and artificial intelligence, creating websites, data-driven applications, and automated systems that help people and businesses operate more efficiently. I enjoy turning ideas into clean, usable web experiences and transforming complex data into clear, actionable insights.

My current focus is on AI agents and workflow automation, designing smart systems that reduce manual work and scale digital operations. I’m constantly learning and evolving, always looking for better ways to combine technology, creativity, and problem-solving.

Outside of work, I enjoy building personal projects, exploring new technologies, and challenging myself to grow every day.</p>
